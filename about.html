            <span>In my professional experience, I have worked as an HD Maps Intern at Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, where I developed solutions for deriving SD maps from HD maps and built a graph neural network model to improve map generation in complex junctions. I have also worked as an Assistant Manager at Suzuki Motor Corporation, where I performed supplier tech reviews and handled body integration of radar and cameras for ADAS in new models. I have a strong background in C++, Python, and various frameworks and libraries, including OpenCV and TensorFlow. I am skilled in machine learning and have experience in developing models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. In my educational and professional experiences, I have demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work effectively in a team. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, and I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to the field of autonomous driving.</span>
