Last year I had the amazing opportunity to co-op at [Vecna Robotics' ](https://www.vecnarobotics.com) HQ in Waltham, Massachusetts. Vecna Robotics is an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) company that specializes in warehouse automation. I joined as a Graduate Robotics Software Intern in their <span class="highlight-blue">Robot Autonomy Team</span> and was later contributing to multiple teams including the Advanced Development Team and the Office of the CTO. I gained experience on a variety of topics such as <span class="highlight-blue">mapping and localization</span> of the robot, different design decisions for <span class="highlight-blue">robot sensing and perception</span> and complete lifecycle of a production-ready codebase.  

Some of the projects I worked on were
* Pallet Detection using a 3D Lidar
* Pallet Detection using a 2D Lidar
* Investigating the state-of-the-art 3D Mapping and Localization solutions
* Investigating different 3D Lidars for Localization and Obstacle Sensing
* Extrinsic Calibration of TOF Sensors with Cameras

I had an extremely rewarding internship experience at Vecna filled with fun, learning and contributing. I would like to thank my managers Ashwin Thangali and Siddharth Chatpar for giving me this amazing opportunity.
